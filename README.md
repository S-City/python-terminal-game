# python-terminal-game

This is one of my first few programs written in the programming language Python. This is a terminal-based program and serves the purpose to help decide any gym goers on what exercises to do based on what muscle groups they want to train. At the beginning of the program would prompt the user to enter their name, and a personalised welcome message would follow.

The user is asked to select their desired muscle group that they would want to train. Based on this, the program would iterate through a list of exercises working the selected muscle group. Users can either add or reject the exercises.

There is a limit of three exercises per muscle group. The user is required to select another muscle group to train alongside with their first choice, and an additional three exercises. The only exception being legs, where is limited to six exercises and there are no secondary muscle group to train alongside with legs.

The program would finally then return the exercise plan, a result of their muscle groups and a list of exercises linked to those muscle groups.
